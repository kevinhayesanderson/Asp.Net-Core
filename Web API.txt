To set which environment our application runs on, 
we need to set up the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable.

We can set the variable through the command prompt by typing 
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Windows 
or 
export ASPNET_CORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Linux.

ASP.NET Core applications use the value of that environment variable to decide which appsettings file to use accordingly.
