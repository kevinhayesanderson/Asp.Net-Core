To set which environment our application runs on, 
we need to set up the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable.

set the variable through the command prompt by typing set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Windows 
or export ASPNET_CORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Linux.

SET ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
echo %ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT%

Onion architecture:
4 layers:
• Domain Layer (Contracts project)
• Service Layer (Service.Contracts project and Service project)
• Infrastructure Layer
• Presentation Layer
The flow of dependencies is towards the core of the Onion.
The deeper the layer resides inside the Onion, the fewer dependencies it has.
Domain layer does not have any direct dependencies
outer layers are all allowed to reference the layers that are directly below them

navigational properties in Entities:
these properties serve the purpose of defining the relationship between our models.
