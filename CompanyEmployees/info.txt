To set which environment our application runs on, 
we need to set up the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable.

set the variable through the command prompt by typing set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Windows 
or export ASPNET_CORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Linux.

SET ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
echo %ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT%
